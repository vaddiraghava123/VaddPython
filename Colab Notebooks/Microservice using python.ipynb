Think of it as the engine that lets you build APIs (ways for different parts of your system to talk to each other).  You use it to define routes (URLs) and what happens when someone visits them.\n","\n","# Flask-RESTful:  Makes it easier to create REST APIs with Flask.  REST APIs are a standard way for applications to communicate.  Flask-RESTful helps organize your API code.\n","\n","# Redis: An in-memory data store. It's super fast for storing and retrieving data. In your microservices, you might use Redis to share data between services (like storing cart information so it's available to both the Cart Service and Order Service) or for caching (storing frequently used data so you don't have to look it up every time)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6170,"status":"ok","timestamp":1729578230219,"user":{"displayName":"Raghavendra V","userId":"05756543296101476977"},"user_tz":300},"id":"OqqBFy643_2f","outputId":"5bce367f-ce62-41e2-a51e-9bf14e93ad5d"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: Flask in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.2.5)\n","Collecting Flask-RESTful\n","  Downloading Flask_RESTful-0.3.10-py2.py3-none-any.whl.metadata (1.0 kB)\n","Collecting redis\n","  Downloading redis-5.1.1-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (9.1 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Werkzeug>=2.2.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask) (3.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Jinja2>=3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask) (3.1.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: itsdangerous>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask) (2.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click>=8.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask) (8.1.7)\n","Collecting aniso8601>=0.82 (from Flask-RESTful)\n","  Downloading aniso8601-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl.metadata (23 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask-RESTful) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Flask-RESTful) (2024.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: async-timeout>=4.0.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from redis) (4.0.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from Jinja2>=3.0->Flask) (3.0.1)\n","Downloading Flask_RESTful-0.3.10-py2.py3-none-any.whl (26 kB)\n","Downloading redis-5.1.1-py3-none-any.whl (261 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m261.3/261.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hDownloading aniso8601-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (52 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m52.8/52.8 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: aniso8601, redis, Flask-RESTful\n","Successfully installed Flask-RESTful-0.3.10 aniso8601-9.0.1 redis-5.1.1\n"]}],"source":["# prompt: install flask , flask-restful , redis command of pip\n","!pip install Flask Flask-RESTful redis\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4623,"status":"ok","timestamp":1729579060322,"user":{"displayName":"Raghavendra V","userId":"05756543296101476977"},"user_tz":300},"id":"dOGJvfpR8Y9W","outputId":"49c5263a-28ce-4cf3-c210-4cdbc465c76b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting marshmallow\n","  Downloading marshmallow-3.23.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (7.6 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=17.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from marshmallow) (24.1)\n","Downloading marshmallow-3.23.0-py3-none-any.whl (49 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/49.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m49.5/49.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: marshmallow\n","Successfully installed marshmallow-3.23.0\n"]}],"source":["# prompt: install Marshmallow for pip command\n","\n","!pip install marshmallow\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"toc_visible":true,"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4","authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPC6UYXFex1e2WuxDphxf7m"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
